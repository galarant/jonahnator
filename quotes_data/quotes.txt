You can explain it in one sentence and get a little bit of a laugh in one sentence.
In Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, one of the tests of whether someone's an android or a human, is they see if they have empathy for animals, and that's happening a billion times a day on Facebook.
People see animals, and some of us are human and click the like button.
Hate is a good way to build a community... among a small group.
I remember teasing Nick Denton, a while back about how negative the site is and saying, We don't have all this class resentment and swiping at all the frauds who are running everything in the US - that's more a British thing.
I tend to be a more positive person.
You don't want everyone to see a piece of content.
You want the people who are really excited about the content to see it.
You're coming to Buzzfeed's homepage not for yourself, but to find something to share with someone else.
It is possible to build a tech company in New York that has really good snacks.
There was an appeal in making a site that would help a democrat get elected president.
In media or in tech companies, there's this natural tendency to spend all the time thinking about your idea and not spending time thinking about how to spread the idea.
And so Mormons are good at both practicing the religion and spreading the religion, and I think that's something that startups folks have to think about a lot too.
What's so exciting to me now is that as Facebook and Twitter and StumbleUpon and Reddit and these social platforms become more mature, you can start to create content for humans, not for robots, and still have massive traffic.
Google can't find scoops because there's no cluster around it yet.
There are no tricks.
We're all teenage girls a little bit.
We hate the celebrity at the party... but I was at a party with a celebrity!
I see it more as kind of an indie rock mentality.
My band is good and all the other bands suck, and that builds a close feeling.
Contrast indie rock to hip-hop where it's like, You don't sell out, you blow up.
When there's a Coke, there's always room for a Pepsi.
Did you know that the Stegosaurus lived further away from the Tyrannosaurus Rex than we are from the Tyrannosaurus Rex in time?
We just think that humans are complex people that like to laugh sometimes, that like to gossip sometimes, that like to know what's going on in the world.
You can say, My site will only publish serious stuff, but the New York Times is going to be right in that (Facebook) news feed next to the cute kittens, and that's where people are going to see it.
They're gonna all be mashed together.
So our thesis is, why don't we do that at the source, as the publisher.
Sometimes we use this metaphor of the Paris cafe.
You go to a cafe and you have a copy of Sartre you have a copy of Le Monde and you're reading your philosophy and you're reading the news of the day.
And then, if you've ever been to Paris you'll see there's always a dog under the next table, so you bend over to pet the dog.
When you turn away from the philosophy and pet the dog, you don't become stupid.
When you flirt with the person at the next table, it doesn't mean you can't understand the philosophy anymore.
It just makes you human.
I'm a typical Capricorn.
I'm hardworking, loyal, sometimes stubborn, and I don't believe in astrology.
People don't do good work when they feel like losers and are second-class citizens within their own company.
At The Huffington Post, we thought of the front page as a one-stop shop for everything you'd need in news.
If you look at the heritage of the best advertising, you can make stuff that is great for both readers and advertisers.
I don't think Don Draper would have loved banner ads.
It's so much easier to write for a person in your life than to write for some imagined readership, so you write something that's more intimate and true.
People used to share things with e-mail on a massive scale.
If you remember e-mail forwards from the late '90s, it was a terrible way to share content.
The biggest misconception people have is that quality is all that matters.
The truth is that quality helps, but there's a ton of high-quality things that don't go anywhere.
A lot of web companies will take a short-term approach and sell to an incumbent and don't end up living up to their full potential.
BuzzFeed started as a lab with a small team where we would play with ideas.
I did parallel entrepreneurship, which was very hard to do.
It was hard to keep your head straight and know which ideas were with which company.
Mormons know that it's not enough to practise your religion - you also have to spread your religion.
I think a lot about how ideas spread, how information spreads, why is it that something you're really proud of and you spend a lot of time creating sometimes doesn't go anywhere, and something that you kind of do on the side, on a lark, ends up getting shared and passed around and having this big impact.
I think the best content on BuzzFeed is something you share with someone else in your life, and it connects you to them.
And that's a big part of what e-mail's about as well.
It's important that all my friends have verified Twitter accounts.
The blue checkmark makes me feel comfortable and like I'm friends with a legit, high-quality person.
I also prefer friends with ridiculously long usernames.
One of the things that is counterintuitive about BuzzFeed is that there's not a natural corollary to what we're doing because it isn't possible to distribute content through word-of-mouth in print.
People go to the front page of BuzzFeed partly because they've seen a bunch of things in their stream, and they're like, Oh, I like this site.
Why don't I go to the source? I think that happens.
But also people are going to look for something to share.
People on Twitter can follow tech if they're interested in tech, or business if they're interested in business, or they can follow celebrities that they're fans of.
People say the Internet's made of cats.
The reason isn't because of cats; it's because people like to have an emotion where they say aww all at the same time.
We're not like something that came before.
When people complain to me about too many animals on Buzzfeed I always ask them whether they're a serial killer and sociopath, or whether they're android.
go viral.
A lot of web companies will take a short-term approach and sell to an incumbent and don't end up living up to their full potential.
If we can entertain and inform people and generate great return for advertisers we can have a much bigger, longer path.
We're not like something that came before us - we're qualitatively different.
There was a long period where newspapers were the only way an advertiser could get its message to the public.
They were essentially monopolies.
Now brands can go direct to the public.
The biggest misconception people have is that quality is all that matters.
The truth is that quality helps, but there's a ton of high-quality things that don't go anywhere.
One of the things that is counterintuitive about BuzzFeed is that there's not a natural corollary to what we're doing because it isn't possible to distribute content through word-of-mouth in print.
People rip out magazine or newspaper articles and mail them, and there's some small amount of distribution, but we're reaching 85 million unique visitors without owning a printing press or a broadcast pipe or anything.
And every day we have to make content that people think is worth sharing, and we don't reach any audience at all unless we make content that people think is so good that they're willing to pass it on and share it with all their friends.
That model doesn't have an offline version of it.
We want to build a sustainable company.
We like to think, What would a media company be if you created one from scratch today? What would a media company be for the era of social and mobile? What would it be like to build that company? Generating revenue is an important part of building a company.
So is having great investigative journalism.
So is having really entertaining content.
We have a pretty broad purview - a pretty broad range of things we do.
What we've found is that content spreads on different networks for different reasons.
There are underlying human dynamics for social content.
There are reasons why people share.
But certain platforms are better for certain types of sharing.
So if you're tweeting about running, you can write about running and people who are interested in running can follow you.
But if you start posting on Facebook constantly about running, and most of your friends don't care about running and actually kind of hate you because you're a runner, or at least it makes them feel bad about them not being a runner or whatever, you know, it doesn't really work that well.
Facebook is much more tied to broad human emotion and things that everyone can relate to, and things that connect people with the people in their lives.
It's not so much about the information in the content; it's about how that content allows you to connect with other people in your life.
So things like humor, things like cute animals, things like breaking news, things where when you engage with the content, you immediately want to share it and bring other people into the conversation.
It's good to not always trust your gut, to have some skepticism about it, and to constantly have new data coming in and constantly question what you actually know.
A lot of what we do at BuzzFeed is give dashboards to every person who works at BuzzFeed where they're seeing how people are engaging with the content they're producing: Is it going up? Is it going down? They can test hypotheses and theories and say, All right, this worked in the past.
Can I make it work again? Can I do something similar? Can I take one part of it and make that work? And you start to learn through having a healthy skepticism and lots of access to new data.
I think there's a lot of over-optimization on the web.
You see this sort of side boob trap or something, where you put some picture of a celebrity whose dress lets you see the side of her boob on the front of your website, and you say, Wow! That gets a really high click-through rate.
If you were a slave to the numbers, you'd start putting more stuff like that and more stuff like that and more stuff like that.
And pretty soon you would have a site full of trashy, salacious garbage, and you would say, Oh, I'm just looking at the numbers, but you would be hitting a local maximum, where lots of people would never want to read your site just because 10% of your readers are horny guys who can't resist clicking, or women who can't resist gawking at celebrities.
If you made something that was compelling and touched people in a deeper way, you might actually... there might be a mountain that you could climb, but if you're just following numbers, you think you're at the top of the mountain because every direction you go looks like it's downward to a lower click-through rate.
Optimization can lead to finding local maximums, but those local maximums often aren't where you actually want to be.
You need to have creative, experimental people trying lots of different things.
And then the data becomes meaningful.
So we were focused on making media for the way people consume media today, for mobile, for social.
young people are the earliest adopters of using smartphones to consume media, and of using the social web as their main source of content.
My guess is that a lot of the media consumption behaviors of young people will start to spread to a broader audience.
Social has really become the starting point - the Facebook newsfeed, the Twitter stream - where most people are finding their news and information now.
People go to the front page of BuzzFeed partly because they've seen a bunch of things in their stream, and they're like, Oh, I like this site.
Why don't I go to the source?
Oh, that article sucks.
This one's not for me.
This isn't my cup of tea.
But this one is perfect, and I'm going to share it with all of my friends.
We don't spend that much time thinking about search.
The aggregators win on search where people cram in key words and do SEO and rewrite stories.
But on social, you want to share the authoritative story - the Ben Smith scoop is going to get re-tweeted a bunch of times, not the rewrite of the Ben Smith scoop.
But the rewrite is going to be what ends up getting a lot of the traffic in Google.
That's the thing that Google is going to have to figure out how to fix over the next years.
Google could have another 10 years of rapid growth and success and drive us around in cars and tell us what to think and look at with glasses, or they could have real problems.
It will be interesting to see.
We have four types of content.
We have news content created by our team of journalists and reporters.
They really are not focused on aggregation; they are calling people, working sources, doing original stuff.
We have entertainment, often characterized by our lists.
And those lists are all original creations, although they often use material from, you know, AP and Reuters and Getty and image libraries and other sources.
Then we have branded content, which is how we make our living, where our revenue comes from.
Fifty of the top 100 brands used BuzzFeed's platform to launch branded content.
And we also have community content, which is where you can go to BuzzFeed, go to the community section, and create your own content and launch it.
Four different types of content, all on top of the same technology platform that we developed.
A few years ago, our traffic was starting to grow, and we had a board meeting, and my board asked me whether we had any revenue.
And I said no.
So banners didn't make much sense to me.
It made much more sense to build a version that uses the same platform for branded content and advertising.
making advertising that actually adds to the product.
It's something that websites have completely failed to do, and largely it's the fault of trying to cram things into little banner ads.
If you take a high-end magazine and rip all the ads out, it's often a worse product.
If you take all of the ads out of a fashion magazine, you lose half the photography, you know?
You have to tell a story.
We created our own form of advertising that was totally proprietary.
It was a real hard slog trying to sell it.
There are over 400 million unique visitors in the network now, and all of them are getting some of the benefit of our data science and our technology.
So, test all your stuff on mobile devices.
If we take the same point and make it not a list, people don't like it as much.
Content can't spread if it's not viewable on mobile.
There'll never be one news source, the way that there's one search engine.
We've made mistakes but we've got most of the big things right.
We embraced social and mobile very early, we've hired amazing people who deeply understand the social web, we've invested in both news and entertainment that gives us great range, and we've generally adapted quickly to our readers needs and habits.
My big goal for 2014 is to not do a BuzzFeed TV show.
The business case is simple: despite a growing hole left by the decline of print media, the public still wants news, entertainment, and great storytelling.
Our ads perform better on mobile!
For us, the truth matters! News needs to be accurate.
Cute kittens need to be cute.
People get in trouble when they sloppily mix the two.
You got to take both seriously!
Generally, if you show people a project and they immediately want to tell someone about it, there's a good chance it will be contagious.
If the initial reaction is unenthusiastic, those things usually aren't contagious.
If you value having an impact and reaching a large number of people, you have a benchmark for doing a good job.
Being interesting and thought-provoking isn't necessarily correlated with being popular.
What I never liked about [SEO] was that you're essentially trying to understand how a machine works or a robot works.
What I love is understanding how the human mind works and what gets people excited and what gets people inspired, and what makes people want to share something.
You don't want everyone to see a piece of content.
You want the people who are really excited about the content to see it.
A lot of web companies will take a short-term approach and sell to an incumbent and don't end up living up to their full potential.
I did parallel entrepreneurship, which was very hard to do.
It was hard to keep your head straight and know which ideas were with which company.
The benefit is something that isn't there.
Then there also are other things where technology doesn't recede to the background, like a lot of the stuff we do with new post formats or slide-y things or quizzes or rubable GIFs.
That's all more in the category of fun technology that you get to play with.
As we get bigger, we've expanded the company to a lot of different cities around the world now.
There was a period where that was frustrating, because we had everyone all in one office, and then we didn't, and now it's moved to another mode.
We have a network forming, we have offices with critical mass that can build parts of what we're doing.
We're doing so much more than we've ever done before, and there's nice big meaty things for people to work on.
BuzzFeed has invested in a model that's more vertically integrated.
We're building the technology and the site and the CMS, and also the brand and the content, and building this full-stack startup.
What we're seeing now is that's become more complicated.
You're starting to see more network-integrated companies
That content is part of a vertically integrated site that lives on the web.
And that same content is going to an app.
And to native content formats on Facebook, on YouTube, on other platforms.
And technology - I'm sort of describing a diagram in my head - technology is important at every single level.
Technology is important for how you create the content: do you have tools to build games or quizzes or beautifully laid out longform articles or breaking news? The way the CMS works and the way that the format works is driven by technology, so having great technology for making content is important.
I think it's becoming much more distributed.
And people are still figuring out what that means.
We care most about what's best for consumers, so it's not like we have an ideological or religious view on where content should live.
Should it be a native app, or on the web, or mobile web? It really should be dictated by what's best for the consumer and what's best long-term for building a media company that can thrive with how people are consuming media today instead of how they consumed media 10 years ago.
Also we should get money back, which allows us to fund doing more of it.
If you have that, it doesn't matter where the content lives, but it does matter that you're able to get some knowledge and learning from it.
That's the thing that traditional media sort of lacks.
It's a huge advantage for a tech-oriented media company that's on a digital platform.
Pushing a deploy to the Buzzfeed.com website is a trivial thing that really any engineer is able to do because we've built all kinds of tools to make deployment easier on web.
That's great, because you can do more faster and have shorter loops and shorter cycles of development.
When you look at our app now, we spent really a year working on underlying architecture and making sure that it loaded quickly, it didn't crash, and it was designed in such a way that we could build some cool features.
Our content wouldn't even be on Facebook if it wasn't for people who thought it was worth sharing with their friends.
I see it as part of a larger ecosystem of content discovery, where apps created by media companies are actually pretty important because there's a place people can discover content they think is worth spreading across a social network.
We will always have a weird, eclectic mix of things that we're creating.
We don't have a universe of a kajillion stories to personalize for each individual person.
It's like, say you hate cute kittens because you're a monster with no empathy.
So you don't see any cute animal content.
Some people really care about what's up with Taylor Swift and the latest in celebrity stuff.
Other people find celebrity news enraging.
I mean, our video business is in the hyper-growth stage.
Things like Dear Kitten, which we made for Purina, is a great piece of content that's also an advertisement for cat food.
It works as content and also has amazing effects on purchase intent.
And then we also have all of the monetization that is part of YouTube, which is kind of light monetization but with the amount of views we have, it can actually add up to something pretty significant.
We don't really have plans to do any print.
Three years ago we were a cat site, an internet meme site.
So a lot has changed in three years.
